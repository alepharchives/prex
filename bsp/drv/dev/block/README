NEXT TO DO
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Make the device_create()d devices into *partitions* rather than whole
disks. Perhaps do this by making ata_disk structures kmem_alloc'd, and
making it a variant union, with variants for

       - whole disks (include model number and stuff)
       - disk partitions (include offset and length)
