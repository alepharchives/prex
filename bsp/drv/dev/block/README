NEXT TO DO
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Handle errors reported from ata_wait?

See if the missing interrupts on that systems machine could be related
to the interrupt disable bit of the PCI config command register,
i.e. are IRQs disabled for the device?

 - Alternatively (and actually this should be done in any case), print
   out the assigned IRQ number and try just using that, not
   overwriting it with the arbitrary choice made in the code.

Testing.
