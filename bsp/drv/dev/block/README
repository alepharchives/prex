NEXT TO DO
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Test multiple-sector transfers. (Just give up on PIO and implement Bus
Master DMA?)

Implement hdd_write.

Fix the locking: have a queue of requests that's dealt with by hdd_ist
and so forth. Buffering will need to be dealt with, too. Bus Master
DMA will make the buffering situation a little easier.
